## Todo CLI (student project)
A small command-line todo manager written as a learning project by Rohan Sonu Bablani (Golixco).

Usage examples:
- `python3 todo.py add "Finish DBMS assignment"`
- `python3 todo.py list`
- `python3 todo.py done 1`

I wrote this while practicing GitHub and Hacktoberfest. Contributions and feedback welcome!
