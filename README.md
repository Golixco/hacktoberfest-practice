## Todo CLI (student project)
A small command-line todo manager written as a learning project by Rohan Sonu Bablani (Golixco).

Usage examples:
- `python3 todo.py add "Finish DBMS assignment"`
- `python3 todo.py list`
- `python3 todo.py done 1`

I wrote this while practicing GitHub and Hacktoberfest. Contributions and feedback welcome!

### Golixco: spam-detection note
Golixco includes a small student-built spam detector that flags obvious spammy phrases (e.g. "win", "click", "buy") using a simple word-scoring approach. If Golixco suspects a message is spam it politely refuses and logs the conversation locally. This is a lightweight, explainable feature intended as a learning exercise.
